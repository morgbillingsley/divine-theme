                <h1>Welcome to Divine Embodiment Hypnotherapy</h1>
                <h4>Allowing you the space, tools, and information to consciously create the Life of your Dreams</h4>
                <p>
                    Hello! I am Vivian Grace C.Ht.<br><br>
                    I am a certified Clinical Hypnotherapist, Mind Body Wellness practitioner and Life Coach.<br><br>
                    I work with clients to address their specific needs and identified goals; including but not limited to anxiety, depression, ptsd, smoking cessation, pain management, stress management, addiction and phobias.<br><br>
                    <strong>Educate - Empower - Embody</strong><br><br>
                    I understand that each client’s personal journey is unique; therefore, my approach is tailored to fit each client’s specific needs.<br><br>
                    It is my goal to create a therapeutic environment that is a comfortable and safe container for my clients to explore their inner beliefs, desires, fears, and traumas. My practice is based upon the principle that each of my clients has the answers they seek within them.<br><br>
                    It is my life’s work to metaphorically walk beside my clients and ask the right questions. In doing so, I create the sacred space necessary to illuminate the Light within them, discover what they truly desire, and identify what blocks them from feeling fulfilled in every part of their life.<br><br>
                    <strong>Connection - Clarity - Conscious Creation</strong><br><br>
                    Hypnosis allows us to identify and improve upon our core beliefs about ourselves and the world so that we may consciously create a more joy-filled life.<br><br>
                    My clients are empowered with the tools and awareness they need to live a life that is aligned with their personal Truth.<br><br>

                    I look forward to working with you.<br>
                    Infinite Blessings,<br>
                    Vivian Grace C.Ht.
